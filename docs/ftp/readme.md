If you're a website owner, you are most probably going to come across the word FTP. FTP stands for **File Transfer Protocol**, a set of "rules" that are followed when files are transferred between devices. It is an essential tool for building websites as it enables you to transfer, upload and download files between two parties - in this case, your device and your website.

# Connecting to FTP

2. Click "FTP" and a new tab should be opened
